## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 70% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg- the other parameters predictions) is explained using this linear model. We can confirm that our r-squared value is approximately the square of our r-value. In a simple linear regression model, the higher the correlation is between two variables, the more that one variable can explain/predict the value of the other.

In addition, the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.36 x 10-6, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
