## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The r-squared value of our linear regression model is 0.71, which means that this linear model explains roughly 70% of the variation in our dependent variable (mpg- the other parameters predictions). We can confirm that our r-squared value is roughly equal to our r-value. The higher the correlation among two variables in a simple linear regression model, the more that one variable can illustrate the value of the other.

Furthermore, our linear regression analysis's p-value is 5.36 x 10-6, which is much lower than our assumed significance level of 0.05 percent. As a result, we can conclude that there is enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis, implying that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The variance of the suspension coils at an aggregate data level is 62 pounds per square inch, which is good value within the limit of 100 pounds per square inch.

When looking at the table below at the lot level, it is clear that there are differences between the lot levels. Lot 3, in particular, stands out from the rest. It is around 170 pounds per square inch, which is in excess of the limit.
